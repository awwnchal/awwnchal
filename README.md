ðŸŒ± ABOUT ME 

As a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computational Mathematics from the University of Illinois at Chicago, I have embarked on a journey to further develop my skills in the field of data science. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Business Analytics at UC Davis, where I am focusing on honing my expertise in data-driven decision making. I am currently working on a practicum project with an innovative, AI-powered personally styled clothing brand. My role involves converting vast amounts of raw data into actionable insights that facilitate informed business decisions. The challenge of this process excites me, and I am eager to share my progress on this project in the near future. 


ðŸ’» My interests are Data Science, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Causal Inference, Data Vizualization and Statistical Modelling.

ðŸŒ‰ Located in San Francisco.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
